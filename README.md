## 🧠 QuickVal – Property Valuation Intelligence

**QuickVal** is a data-driven system designed to evaluate property prices based on age and market factors. It empowers real estate professionals and individuals with transparent, fair, and insightful valuation support using statistical modeling and machine learning.

---

### 🔍 Overview

Inaccurate or biased property pricing can lead to unfair deals and missed opportunities. **QuickVal** solves this by providing a model-driven approach to estimate property values using real-world factors such as:

* Property age
* Number of rooms and bathrooms
* Location area
* Property type
* Historical price data

---

### 🎯 Key Features

* ✅ Predicts reasonable property pricing
* 🏘️ Supports multiple input features like age, rooms, area
* 📊 Trained with real market data (`csp.csv`)
* ⚙️ Built using machine learning models (Random Forest Classifier)
* 🔁 Easily re-trainable on updated datasets

---

### 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python
* **Libraries**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `Pickle`
* **ML Techniques**: Feature scaling, One-hot encoding, Random Forest
* *(No Flask used — this is a backend/ML model only)*

### ⚙️ How to Run

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quickval.git
cd quickval
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

#### 3. Train the model

```bash
python model.py
```

This will generate:

* `model.pkl` — trained model
* `scaler.pkl` — scaler used during training
* `columns.pkl` — feature columns used
* `feature_dict.pkl` — one-hot encoding dictionary

### 🧪 Dataset Info

The dataset `csp.csv` includes historical property data with labeled approval/pricing status. You can modify or extend this dataset to match your domain or region.

---

### 💡 Use Case

> **Real estate companies**, **valuation platforms**, and **data enthusiasts** can integrate QuickVal into their tools or pipelines for fair, automated property valuation suggestions.

---

### 🔄 Retraining Tips

If you modify the dataset or feature set:

* Update `model.py` accordingly
* Delete the `.pkl` files and retrain using `python model.py`

---

### 📌 To-Do / Future Work

* [ ] Add web interface (Flask/Streamlit)
* [ ] Integrate location-based pricing data (e.g., average price per sq ft)
* [ ] API deployment for production use
